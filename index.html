  <p>I am currently studying at AUB's <em><strong> <a href="https://www.aub.edu.lb/osb/Pages/default.aspx">Olayan School of Business</a> majoring in Business and minoring Philosophy</strong> and potentianlly Economics.</em> I know it seems random and
    scattered but that is exactly what or <strong>who I am</strong>. I find myself being easily interested in many different topics and sometimes latch onto them extremely tightly if I am truly taken by them. Which explains why I am now taking on this challenge of <em>learning how to code</em>. I
    previously took an introductory course to computer science (mainly coding in Java) which did interest me however was focused on other challenges at the time. I hope to be able to follow this journey to its end to understand how the digital world
    works to some degree, and also to satisfy some part of me that wants to learn a bit about everything.</p><br />
